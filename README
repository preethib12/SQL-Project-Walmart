# SQL Project â€“ Walmart Sales Analysis

This project explores and analyzes Walmart sales data using **SQLite**. The goal was to clean the data, transform it, and extract insights using SQL queries.

## Dataset

The dataset was provided in an unstructured format (`walmart_data`) and then cleaned and inserted into a new structured table (`walmart_sales`) with proper column names and data types.

## Data Cleaning & Setup

- Created a new table `walmart_sales` with appropriate data types.
- Used `CAST` and `GLOB` to convert and filter numeric values.
- Reformatted the date column for time-based queries.

## SQL Analysis

20 SQL queries were written to analyze:

- Total sales and quantity by city and product line
- Best-selling and highest-rated products
- Revenue trends by month, branch, and customer type
- Unique invoice counts and popular payment methods
- Simple functions like `ROUND`, `UPPER`, `LIKE`, and `COUNT(DISTINCT)`

## Sample Questions Answered

- Total sales per city
- Which gender spends more on average?
- What are the top 3 revenue-generating product lines?
- Which customer type generates higher revenue?

## Tools Used

- SQLite (tested on [sqliteonline.com](https://sqliteonline.com/))
- GitHub for version control and project sharing

## How to Use

1. Import or paste the SQL scripts into your SQLite environment.
2. Run the table creation and data insertion queries first.
3. Execute analysis queries to view insights.
